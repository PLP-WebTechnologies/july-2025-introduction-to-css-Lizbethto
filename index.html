            <h2>What is CSS</h2>
            <p class="text">CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to describe how the content of a webpage should look. While HTML provides the structure, CSS controls the appearance — such as colors, text styles, spacing, and layout. The word “cascading” refers to how styles are applied in a specific order, allowing some rules to override others. In short, CSS is what makes web pages visually attractive and easy to read.</p>

            <h2>Why Learn CSS</h2>
            <p class="text">CSS is important because it makes websites look attractive, easy to read, and user-friendly. It allows you to control colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts without changing the HTML structure. With CSS, you can make a single design work well on phones, tablets, and computers, improving the overall user experience. It also helps keep code clean by separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), making websites easier to update and maintain.
